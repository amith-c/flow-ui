# FlowUI   

### The easy-to-use, semantically designed CSS UI framework for you to easily design and customize your website. Simple add a `.button` class to create a stylized button and customize it with `.filled` or `.outlined`. It's that simple.

## Usage
### You can get the CSS file containing the styles from the jsDelivr CDN and add it to the `<head>` section of your HTML page:

## Components
### 1. Buttons
#### There are 3 steps to styling a button: first add the `.button` class to the `<button>` element. Then add the `.default` variant for the normal blue colour ( more colours coming up ). And lastly, use the `.filled` class for a filled button
    <button class='button default filled'>
### 2. Typography
